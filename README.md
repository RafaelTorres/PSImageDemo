The Boilerplate used is [Pepperoni](http://getpepperoni.com/), Which is used to configure structure and best practices in create React Native projects quickly.

Some modules of the modules with which we worked with this project were the following:

- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/introduction)
- [Immutable JS](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/)
- [Eslint](https://eslint.org/)
- [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/)
